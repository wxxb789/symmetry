# TODO

Manual tasks and deferred maintenance discovered during scoped changes.

## SEO / repository metadata

- [ ] Upload `docs/assets/symmetry-social-preview.png` as the GitHub social
      preview. GitHub has no REST/GraphQL API for this: open
      **Settings → Social preview → Edit → Upload an image**, then confirm the
      card renders on the repository page. The image is 1280×640 and mirrors the
      README banner (`docs/assets/symmetry-banner.png`).

## Dead-code candidates

- [ ] Revalidate and remove the unused `JsonDocument` alias in
      `control/lib/symmetry_control/goals/schemas.ex:1431`
      (`SymmetryControl.Goals.GoalExternalWait`). The 0006h focused Control run
      reported the unused alias; a scoped search of that module found only its
      alias declaration. Leave removal and verification to separate maintenance.
